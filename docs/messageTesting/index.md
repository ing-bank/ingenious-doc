# **Message Testing**  <span style="color:#FF6200"></span>  


!!! info "What is Message Testing?"

    Message testing involves verifying the functionality, performance, and reliability of messaging systems like :

    :one: Java Messaging Service (JMS)

    :two: Kafka 

    :three: Flat files

    
    For JMS, it includes functional, performance, load, and integration testing to ensure messages are correctly sent, received, and processed. Kafka testing focuses on producer and consumer functionality, performance, and scalability under high traffic. Flat file testing involves validating data format and content, measuring read/write performance, and ensuring proper data exchange between systems. Overall, message testing ensures robust, efficient, and reliable communication in applications relying on real-time data processing.


!!! abstract "How does INGenious perform Message Testing?"
    INGenious uses libraries like `ibm.mq` or `tibjms` and their capabilities to interact with the message queues and perform automated testing against it. 
    Similarly for Kafka, it uses `apache kafka client`.
    INGenious creates an abstraction layer on top of all the Queues and Kafka actions and capabilities, making it easy for even non-technical people to write automated tests.

    Most Message actions are pre-built inside INGenious. So the users can simply select them from the INGenious IDE making test design fast and easy.
