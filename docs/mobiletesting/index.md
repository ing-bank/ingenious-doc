!!! info "What is Mobile App Testing?"

    Mobile App testing has two flavors :

    :one: It is a form of end-to-end testing where the business functionality or the application behavior is tested through the mobile application. In this form of testing you mimic how an end user interacts with the application in real world.

    :two: Another flavor of Mobile App Testing is to check the non-functional aspects like the look and feel, mobile element alignment, colors etc. This often includes accessibility and performance testing as well.


!!! abstract "How does INGenious perform Mobile Application Tests?"
    INGenious uses Appium and its capabilities to interact with the Mobile application and perform automated testing against it. INGenious creates an abstraction layer on top of all the Appium actions and capabilities, making it easy for even non-technical people to write automated tests.

    All Appium actions are pre-built inside INGenious. So the users can simply select them from the INGenious IDE making test design fast and easy.
