# INGenious | Code view

INGenious IDE (the user interface) uses the code and logic written in the INGenious **Engine** to test applications.
This makes the **Engine**, the heart of the solution. All test actions (Browser or API) , assertions and every other logic is built inside this Engine.

INGenious exposes this **Engine** as [`Maven`](#) project which can easily be imported into your favourite IDE. After that you can perform any of these actions :

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :new: __New Actions__ using existing libraries
- :material-arrow-up-bold-hexagon-outline: __Update Actions__ which already exist
- :material-test-tube: __Import New libraries__ for new actions

</div>

-------------------------------

!!! Tip
  
    INGenious is built in Java. So anything and everything that can be coded with java, can be done with INGenious!
