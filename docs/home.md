##  Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
-----------------------
* Easy to get started with build-in `record`, `spy` and `heal` features

* Quick creation of test flow scaffoldings and boilerplate reusables

* Reusable components block for **reusing scripts**

* Intuitive **Test-data parameterisation**  

* Environment-based test-data set up and execution (Example: `DEV`, `TEST`, `ACCEPTANCE`) 

* Built-in Dynamic Data creation actions

* Platform independent - Can be used in any operating system supporting java, like **Windows**, **MAC**, **Linux**


##  Integrated BDD 
-----------------------
* Built-in `Gherkin` editor for writing **feature files**

* Imports **feature files** to generate the corresponding Test scenarios, `Step Definition` scaffoldings and Test Data

* Generates BDD style reporting afetr execution


##  Azure DevOps  
-----------------------

* Rich **command line interface** to run test cases and pass propeties and variables at run time

* Easy to add `cli` execution commands to Azure DevOps YAML files 

* Generates **Nunit** report which shows the test results (including `execution logs`, `screenshots`, `request payloads`, `response payloads` directly in Azure DevOps)

* Seamless integration into **Azure DevOps Test Plans** to report back the execution status in the Test Plan

* Execute failed testcases in a test set automatically after a run


##  Customization  
-----------------------

* Addition of new methods for project specific requirements is possible through the `Engine` project

* Enhancing an built-in method is also possible through the same way

* Incorporation of external libraries is also possible
