!!! info "What is Browser Testing?"

    Browser testing has two flavors :

    :one: It is a form of end-to-end testing where the business functionality or the application behavior is tested through the browser. In this form of testing you mimic how an end user interacts with the application in real world.

    :two: Another flavor of Browser Testing is to check the non-functional aspects like the look and feel, web element alignment, colors etc. This often includes accessibility and performance testing as well.


!!! abstract "How does INGenious perform Browser Tests?"
    INGenious uses Playwright and its capabilities to interact with the Browser and perform automated testing against it. INGenious creates an abstraction layer on top of all the Playwright actions and capabilities, making it easy for even non-technical people to write automated tests.

    All Playwright actions are pre-built inside INGenious. So the users can simply select them from the INGenious IDE making test design fast and easy.
